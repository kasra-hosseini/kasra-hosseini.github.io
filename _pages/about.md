I am a Senior Applied Scientist in the ML Core team @ Zalando.

Currently, my primary focus is exploring the applications of Large Language Models (LLMs) and multi-modal models in semantic search and information retrieval, harnessing their capabilities to make search and product discovery more context-aware and more intuitive. 

I have been also working on assessing the potential risks of LLM-integrated applications and developing strategies to mitigate them.
